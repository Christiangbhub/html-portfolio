<h2>My top 3 Best Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Avater: Aang the last airbender</h3>
<p>
  To be honest, this just came out a few weeks on Netflix, but it is the
  live-action of the animated series of Nickelodeon's The Avater.
</p>

<h3>The Hatful Eight</h3>
<p>
  This has a lot of violence and action and a bit of mystery. Trust me you need
  to watch this.
</p>

<h3>The One Piece</h3>
<p>
  One of my favorite animes to watch.This is about a young pirate who wants to
  find the hidden treasure known as the one piece.
